Minttu,

we got this network capture from one of the yber defense sensors, can
you please review it? Apparently there was some targeted phishing
recently and we are worried if someone fell victim...

Btw, please use this template:
1. What has happened?
2. What is the timeline of the events?
3. What possibly interesting/sensitive/confidential data has been stolen?
4. What methods did the attacker use?

Thanks,
 Ville Y.
